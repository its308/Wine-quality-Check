# Wine Quality Prediction: Neural Network from Scratch

This repository contains an implementation of a neural network from scratch to predict wine quality based on various chemical properties. The project explores data preprocessing, model implementation, and evaluation techniques.

## Features
- Custom-built neural network implementation without external ML libraries.
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering.
- Training and evaluation of the neural network on wine quality data.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is `winequality-red.csv`, which contains various chemical properties of red wine samples along with their quality ratings.

## Installation
To run this project, install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib
```

## Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook to execute the project:
```bash
jupyter notebook wine-quality-check.ipynb
```

## Results
- The model predicts wine quality based on chemical properties.
- Evaluations include accuracy and loss metrics.

## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! Feel free to fork this repository and improve the model.
